1.  Wash tissue 3 x 5 minutes 0.01M (1X) PBS  at room temperature

2. Block wash: Rinse tissue in blocking solution (10% donkey serum, PBT [0.25% Triton-X in 1X PBS]) for 2 hours at room temp.

3. Incubate slide overnight at 4°C with primary antibody solution (10% donkey serum, PBT [0.25% Triton-X in 1X PBS], and 1:1000 anti-GFAP (Alexa Fluor 488, Millipore, MAB3402X)
Note: KEEP IN DARK DURING AND AFTER GFAP ANTIBODY IS ADDED
Day 2:
4. Wash slides 3X 10 minutes 0.01M PBS at room temperature

5. Remove from PBS, mount on slides, apply coverslips with mounting media (NOTE: do in dark or low light)
